    "- The majority of employees report high levels of satisfaction with their work environment, job involvement, and job satisfaction. A positive work culture is reflected in the distribution of satisfaction levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales executives and developers are the most numerous job roles, indicating potential areas of strength within the organization. However, the scarcity of technical architects suggests a gap that may need attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most employees travel rarely, with only a small percentage traveling frequently. This information can be valuable for understanding the organization's mobility expectations and potential impacts on employee performance.\n",

    "- The majority of employees live within 5 miles of the workplace, suggesting proximity as a factor in residence choices. Outliers, such as those living more than 25 miles away, may indicate unique preferences or circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A significant number of employees hold a bachelor's degree, followed by those with a master's degree. This distribution provides insights into the educational qualifications of the workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of hourly rates is diverse, indicating varied compensation structures within the organization. Further analysis can explore the relationship between hourly rates and other employee factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of employees are in lower job levels, with the count decreasing as job levels increase. This suggests a hierarchical structure with opportunities for career progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Salary hike percentages are diverse, with the majority receiving hikes of 14% or less. Understanding the distribution can inform discussions about compensation fairness and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most employees report high levels of relationship satisfaction at work, contributing to a positive workplace environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work experience is diverse, with a significant portion of employees having 10 years or less. This indicates a mix of experienced and relatively newer employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of employees prefer shorter training sessions, with 2 and 3 hours being the most common. This insight can guide the design and delivery of training programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employees generally report high levels of satisfaction with their work-life balance, reflecting a positive aspect of the organizational culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of experience years at the current company is right-skewed, indicating some employees with relatively higher tenure. This could influence organizational stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of experience years in the current role is right-skewed, suggesting diversity in the duration of roles. Understanding this can aid in optimizing role transitions and employee development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most employees experienced a promotion within the last year or less. This may indicate a focus on career progression and opportunities for growth within the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of years with the current manager is right-skewed, suggesting some employees have longer working relationships with their managers. Strong relationships may positively impact performance.\n",

    "- **Age Distribution**: The data shows a wide range of ages across different departments, reflecting a diverse mix of experience levels. The youngest employee is 18 years old and works in the Research & Development department, while the oldest employee is 60 years old and works in the Sales department. The mean age of the employees is 36.92 years, with a standard deviation of 9.13 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction by Gender**: The data reveals a slight difference in job satisfaction levels between male and female employees. Male employees have the highest mean job satisfaction of 2.75, while female employees have a mean job satisfaction of 2.68. The job satisfaction ratings range from 1 (Low) to 4 (Very High).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attrition Analysis**: The data indicates a significant impact of marital status on attrition rates. Single employees have the highest total attrition count, with 94 individuals leaving the company. Single employees also have the highest mean attrition rate of 24.48%, indicating a higher proportion of attrition within this marital status category. Divorced employees show the minimum attrition rate of 10.09%, suggesting higher retention within this group. Married employees have a mean attrition rate of 12.43%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overtime Work by Gender and Marital Status**: The data demonstrates a notable variation in overtime work patterns based on gender and marital status. The combination of males who are married and work overtime has the highest count (96 individuals). This insight can guide workforce management and scheduling strategies. The combination of females who are single and work overtime has the lowest count (12 individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Ratings by Gender**: The data illustrates a similar distribution of performance ratings between male and female employees. Performance ratings range from 1 (Low) to 4 (Outstanding). Both genders predominantly receive ratings of 3 (Excellent), with males having a slightly higher count in this category (473 males vs. 452 females). Females have a slightly higher count in the ratings of 2 (Good) and 4 (Outstanding), while males have a slightly higher count in the rating of 1 (Low).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Rating by Number of Companies Worked**: The data suggests a potential positive correlation between performance ratings and the number of companies worked for. The average performance rating generally increases as the number of companies worked for increases, implying that employees with diverse work experiences tend to perform well. The highest average performance rating of 3.29 is observed for employees who have worked for six companies, while the lowest average performance rating of 2.90 is observed for employees who have worked for one company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Rating by Distance from Home**: The data indicates slight variations in performance ratings based on the distance from home. Employees living within 15 miles generally have higher ratings than those living farther away. The highest average performance rating of 3.13 is observed for employees living within 5 miles, while the lowest average performance rating of 2.86 is observed for employees living between 26 and 30 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction and Attrition**: The data reveals a potential connection between job satisfaction levels and retention. Employees who left the company (attrition: Yes) have a lower average job satisfaction of 2.52 compared to those who stayed (attrition: No) with an average satisfaction of 2.77. This finding suggests that improving job satisfaction could contribute to higher employee retention rates.\n",
    "- **Promotion Rates by Education Level**: The data shows relatively consistent promotion rates across different education levels, ranging from approximately 59% to 64%. The education levels range from 1 (Below College) to 5 (Doctorate). The highest promotion rate of 63.93% is observed for employees with education level 4 (Master's Degree), while the lowest promotion rate of 58.82% is observed for employees with education level 1 (Below College).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction by Hourly Rate**: The data indicates a relationship between hourly rates and job satisfaction levels. Job satisfaction varies across different hourly rates, with the mean satisfaction ranging from 2.58 to 3.16. Higher hourly rates tend to correspond with higher satisfaction levels. The highest average job satisfaction of 3.16 is observed for employees with an hourly rate of 100, while the lowest average job satisfaction of 2.58 is observed for employees with an hourly rate of 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the key findings, the following implications and recommendations can be derived for human resource management and organizational development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marital Status Impact**: The data suggests that marital status has a significant impact on attrition rates, especially for single employees. This implies that single employees may face more challenges or dissatisfaction in their work environment, leading to higher turnover. Therefore, it is recommended to implement targeted retention strategies for single employees, such as providing more social support, flexible work arrangements, or career development opportunities.\n",
    "- **Overtime Management**: The data reveals that the combination of males who are married and work overtime has the highest count, indicating a possible imbalance in workload distribution or work-life balance. This may result in lower job satisfaction, higher stress, or lower performance for this group of employees. Therefore, it is recommended to review the overtime work patterns and ensure a fair and efficient allocation of tasks and resources. Moreover, it is recommended to promote a healthy work-life balance for all employees, especially those who work overtime, by providing wellness programs, counseling services, or recognition and rewards.\n",
    "- **Performance and Experience**: The data indicates a positive correlation between performance ratings and the number of companies worked for, suggesting that employees with diverse work experiences tend to perform well. This implies that the company can benefit from encouraging diverse career paths for its employees, as well as attracting and retaining talent with varied backgrounds and skills. Therefore, it is recommended to foster a culture of learning and innovation, where employees are motivated to explore new opportunities, acquire new knowledge, and apply their skills in different contexts. Additionally, it is recommended to leverage the expertise and experience of high-performing employees, by providing mentoring, coaching, or knowledge sharing platforms.\n",
    "- **Proximity Influence**: The data shows slight variations in performance ratings based on the distance from home, implying that proximity to the workplace may influence employee performance. This may be due to factors such as commuting time, transportation costs, or environmental conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the location and accessibility of the workplace, as well as the preferences and needs of the employees, when making decisions about workforce planning and development. Furthermore, it is recommended to provide alternative or flexible work options, such as telecommuting, remote work, or co-working spaces, for employees who live farther away or face commuting challenges.\n",
    "- **Attrition and Job Satisfaction Link**: The data reveals a potential connection between job satisfaction levels and retention, indicating that employees who left the company had lower job satisfaction than those who stayed. This suggests that improving job satisfaction could contribute to higher employee retention rates, as well as higher performance and productivity. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct regular surveys or feedback sessions to measure and monitor employee satisfaction, as well as to identify and address the factors that affect employee satisfaction, such as compensation, benefits, work environment, leadership, communication, or recognition.\n",
    "- **Education Level and Promotions**: The data shows relatively consistent promotion rates across education levels, suggesting a fair promotion system that does not discriminate based on educational qualifications. This implies that the company values the performance and potential of its employees, rather than their formal credentials. Therefore, it is recommended to continue to uphold the merit-based promotion system, as well as to ensure equal opportunities for career growth for all employees, regardless of their education level. Moreover, it is recommended to provide continuous learning and development opportunities for employees, such as training, education assistance, or certification programs, to enhance their skills and competencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hourly Rate and Job Satisfaction**: The data indicates a relationship between hourly rates and job satisfaction levels, suggesting that higher hourly rates tend to correspond with higher satisfaction levels. This implies that compensation is an important factor that influences employee satisfaction, as well as motivation and retention. Therefore, it is recommended to review and adjust the hourly rates periodically, based on market trends, industry standards, and employee performance. Additionally, it is recommended to implement a comprehensive and transparent reward system, that recognizes and rewards employees for their contributions, achievements, and behaviors, using both monetary and non-monetary incentives."
